# React Native Test Search

This is a simple react-native project that I made for a trial run for a part time job. It simulates a search page functionality on react native. 

The search function will call an API which returns the filtered data.

#
## React Native

The app is made with react-native.

1. Setup your environment by following [this](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
2. ```npx react-native init <project_name>```
3. ```npm install``` to install all dependencies

> [reactnativelements](https://reactnativeelements.com/) is used for the UI.

#
## MySQL

MySQL is used for the database.

#
## Loopback 4

Loopback 4 is used for the API endpoints.

1. Follow this [link](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Getting-started.html#create-a-new-project) to setup your Loopback 4 server.
2. Then follow [this](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Connecting-to-MySQL.html) to connect to your MySQL database.
3. ```npm start``` to start your server.

> When developing locally, use the local IP address of your emulator (usually 10.0.0.1 or 10.0.0.2) to fetch the data.
